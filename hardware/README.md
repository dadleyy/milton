# Milton Hardware

> [YMMV][ymmv]; Get creative with the esp32c3 mounting. Soldering some female headers to a cute little
> electrocookie protoboard was satisfactory enough for me. At the end of the day we're just using a single
> logic pin, and the 3.3v/ground connections.

## Printed Parts

| File | Quanitity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `generic-rail-attachment-base.stl` | 3 | This part is re-used as a way to provide a secure base to various attachments using m3 screws. |
| `filament-guide-with-wheel-slot.stl` | 1 | When using a top-mounted spool holder like [this one][fila], the filament being fed through the material sensor unit may erode away its plastic. This part helps keep the filament being fed at an angle to minimize this problem |
| `led-strip-rail-attachment-base.stl` | 1 | Attaches to a `generic-rail-attachment-base` and provides m3 screw holes for the `led-strip-main-rail`. |
| `led-strip-main-rail.stl` | 1 | The main led strip holder. During assembly, it may be helpful to use velcro instead of any adhesive that came with the led strip. |
| `electrocookie-protoboard-holder.stl` | 1 | The xiao-esp32c3 is connected to our strip of neopixel lights via a simple protoboard |
